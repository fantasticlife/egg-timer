module CALCULATION_COMMONS_ONLY_SI
  
  # # A method for calculating the end date of scutiny periods based on days on which the House of Commons must be sitting or on a short adjournment, used for Commons only negative and made affirmative Statutory Instruments.
  # The calculation counts in actual sitting days and requires the start date and the number of days to count.
  # The calculation is defined by the [Statutory Instruments Act 1946 Section 7 paragraph 1 ](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/25/part/2#section-20-2) as modified by [paragraph 2](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo6/9-10/36/section/7#section-7-2).
