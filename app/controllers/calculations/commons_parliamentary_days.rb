module CALCULATION_COMMONS_PARLIAMENTARY_DAYS
  
  # # A method for calculating scrutiny periods during which the House of Commons must be sitting, used for treaty period B.
  # The calculation counts a day whenever the House of Commons has a parliamentary sitting day, requiring the date of the government statement that the treaty should nonetheless be ratified and the number of days to count.
  # 1st September 2020 - we have assumed that the trigger for this calculation is the date of the government statement **and** that this day counts toward the total if it is a parliamentary sitting day in the House of Commons.
