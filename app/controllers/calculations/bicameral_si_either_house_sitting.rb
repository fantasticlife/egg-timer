module CALCULATION_BICAMERAL_SI_EITHER_HOUSE_SITTING
  
  # # A method for calculating the end date of a scrutiny period, based on days on which **either** House must be sitting or on a short adjournment. This method is used for bicameral negative and made affirmative Statutory Instruments.
  # The calculation counts in actual sitting days, requiring the start date and the number of days to count.
  # The calculation is defined by the [Statutory Instruments Act 1946 Section 7 paragraph 1](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo6/9-10/36/section/7#section-7-1), though a different calculation may be required if the instrument is laid under another Act - as per [paragraph 3](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo6/9-10/36/section/7#section-7-3).

    # For made affirmatives this will be the day on which the instrument was made, if that day was a scrutiny day. This is defined by the [Statutory Instruments Act 1946 Section 5 paragraph 1](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo6/9-10/36/section/5#section-5-1).
