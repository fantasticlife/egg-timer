# A method for calculating scrutiny periods during which the House of Commons must be sitting, used for treaty period B.

The calculation counts a day whenever the House of Commons has a parliamentary sitting day, requiring the date of the government statement that the treaty should nonetheless be ratified and the number of days to count.

1st September 2020 - we have assumed that the trigger for this calculation is the date of the government statement **and** that this day counts toward the total if it is a parliamentary sitting day in the House of Commons.

## We start counting on the **first day when the House of Commons has a parliamentary sitting day**.

This may include the day of the government statement.

Unless that day is a House of Commons parliamentary sitting day, then ...

... if there is a future House of Commons parliamentary sitting day ...

... we set the date to that day.

If we didn't find a **future House of Commons parliamentary sitting day** in our calendar, we can't calculate the scrutiny period, ...

... this error message is displayed ...

... and we stop looking for a scrutiny period end date.

Otherwise, we've established that the day of the government statement is a House of Commons parliamentary sitting day, so we don't have to cycle through the calendar to find a subsequent one.

We've found the first House of Commons parliamentary sitting day so we start counting from day 1.

## Whilst the number of days weâ€™re counting is less than the target number of days to count ...

... continue to the **next day**.

... and add 1 to the day count if this is a House of Commons parliamentary sitting day.

... if the calendar has no record of what type of day this is, we can't calculate the end date, ...

... this error message is displayed to users ...

... and we stop looking through the calendar.

Return the anticipated end date of the scrutiny period for display.
