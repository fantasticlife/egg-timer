</pre></code><h1>A method for calculating the end date of scrutiny periods during which <strong>both</strong> Houses must be sitting or on a short adjournment, used for made affirmative Statutory Instruments where this is set out by their enabling Act. Also used for Legislative Reform Orders, Public Body Orders and Localism Orders.</h1>
<p>The Statutory Instrument Act 1946 <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo6/9-10/36/section/7#section-7-1">sets out</a> that - in calculating the scrutiny period for an SI under that Act - “no account shall be taken of any time during which Parliament is dissolved or prorogued or during which <em>both</em> Houses are adjourned for more than four days.” This applies to the majority of made affirmative instruments.</p>
<p>Made affirmatives laid under different Acts follow other rules, for example: the National Insurance Contributions Act 2014 <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2014/7/section/5/enacted#section-5-9">sets out</a>, “no account is to be taken of any time ... during which either House is adjourned for more than four days.</p>
<p>This calculation deals with the case where days are not counted if <em>either</em> House is adjourned for more than four days.</p>
<p>The rules governing the time period for Legislative Reform Orders are set out in the <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/51/section/19#section-19">Legislative and Regulatory Reform Act 2006 section 19</a>.</p>
<p>The rules governing the time period for Public Body Orders are set out in the <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2011/24/section/11#section-11-12">Public Bodies Act 2011 section 11 (12)</a>.</p>
<p>The rules governing the time period for Localism Orders are set out in the <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2011/20/enacted#section-19-14">Localism Act 2011 section 19 (14)</a>.</p>
